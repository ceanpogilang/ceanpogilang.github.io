            <h2>1. Heart Disease (Coronary Artery Disease)</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Heart disease refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart, such as coronary artery disease, which is caused by the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. This can lead to heart attacks, heart failure, or arrhythmias.</p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <h3>Food Recommendation:</h3>
            <p>Maintaining a heart-healthy lifestyle involves eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, particularly dark green, orange, and yellow ones like spinach, carrots, and berries, which are rich in essential nutrients. It's important to include whole grains such as oats, whole wheat bread, and brown rice to support heart health by providing fiber and vital minerals. Balancing calories with physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight, reducing the risk of heart disease. Choosing lean meats, fish, and plant-based options, while limiting sodium, saturated fats, and alcohol, further supports cardiovascular health. Lastly, reducing added sugars and processed foods is crucial for preventing obesity and heart-related issues.</p>

            <h3>Exercise Recommendation:</h3>
            <p>Engage in moderate-intensity aerobic exercises such as walking, cycling, swimming, or jogging for at least 150 minutes per week (about 30 minutes, 5 days a week). These activities help improve heart function, lower blood pressure, and boost circulation. Incorporating strength training exercises, such as weightlifting or bodyweight exercises (e.g., squats, lunges), two or more days a week helps build muscle mass, improve metabolism, and support overall heart health.</p>
